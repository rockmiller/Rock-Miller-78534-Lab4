Goal:
Take a set of names, generate soundex codes for it, and pretty-print the names 
function is getSoundexCode(name)
use JSON to store the list of names(soundex)
format the JSON data

Two ways to enter names: select with radio button (1,2) to select
1) Enter a comma-separated string in a box
split the string and put the pieces into nameArray
error-trap a no-entry box
2) Load a file of names into nameArray (file operation)
maybe show in a table widget?

Generate List of Names with Soundex Codes
a) loop/iterate nameArray items into the getSoundexCode function
b) format results into kv pairs
c) store kv pairs in object instances (like a dict)
d) serialize the object instances into a JSON file
e) display the JSON file on the browser

Pretty-print the soundex list 
a) format is "${name} ({soundex})" sorted by name
b) either use the object or load the JSON file 
c) last separator is "and"
d) print to console, or to plain text file (maybe a radio button?)
